# EECS481_VoiceOptimizer

Synopsis

This is an EECS481 course project, maintained by Shuoyang Cui, Samir Desai, Shengjie Pan, and Siyuan Sheng.


Code Example

The program mainly invokes functions in AVFoundation libary to process and optimize voice.
Code is still in development.


Motivation

People with limited speech ability usually find it hard to express themselves clearly, as their oral language is often interrupted by unexpected pauses and unusual accent. Although they can speak complete sentences, their voice is sometimes hard to understand and unrecognizable to the voice control on smart devices. In a special case, people with limited speech ability together with physical disabilities require extra care, but their oral language hinder them from communicating with others efficiently and utilizing artificial intelligence instead of human care. Thus, it is necessary to develop individual-designed hardware and software to help them to work and study like other people. This memo discusses a possible solution by using software to process people’s voice in order to make it clearer and easier to understand. 

The goal of the project is to help Brad to easily communicate with others and utilize artificial intelligence via voice control. Also, the project should shed light on the solution for other people with limited speech ability. 


Installation

This project is still in development.


API Reference

AVFoundation: https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/
UIKit: https://getuikit.com/docs/core.html


Tests

There are several test audio files in the audiofiles directory. Use these test audio as input, and play the optimized audio to Siri. Siri can recognize the optimized voice in a successful test.


Contributors

Shuoyang Cui: Responsible for the UI design and implement.

Samir Desai: Research about the new features, now working on eliminating noise

Shengjie Pan and Siyuan Sheng： Responsible for the core code part, including record and play voice, implement and test new features.
